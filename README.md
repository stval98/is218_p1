# Group Project \#1: Design a web-based user management system

1. This is a group project and each team can have up to 4 members.
2. Each team must submit the following items on moodle (1) a readme file containing all the team member names; (2) source code; and (3) the AFS link (you need to publish your system on AFS publicly). Without a readme file, or source code, or AFS, the submission will be desk-rejected without a review.
3. A team should choose one member to make one submission on moodle.

***System requirements (95%)***
Please design a simple user management system. The system must have user sign-up, sign-out, and login functions
The system should have a user log-in page taking the following information from users:
+ User name: must be an email address
+ Password: it must be masked
The login page should have two buttons: log-in and sign-up.
1. After a user clicks the log-in, the system should direct the user to a new page showing the user’s profile: first and last name, College, and major. On this new page, it should have a sign-out button. If the user clicks the sign-out button, the system should direct the user to a new page showing the msg: “You have successfully signed out.”
2. If the user clicks sign-up, the system goes to the sign-up page.

The system should have a user sign-up page taking the following information from users
+ User name: must be an email address
+ Password: it must be masked
+ First name
+ Last name
+ College
+ Major
After signing up, the system should direct the user to the user profile page containing the above-collected information.
For any input fields, the system should have simple input validation capability:
1. No empty fields are allowed after clicking any buttons
2. User name must be an email
3. Names should not have numbers in them
Aesthetics (5%) Style your pages using CSS to make them polished.
